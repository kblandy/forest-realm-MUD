# forest-realm-MUD
Work-in-progress text based rpg

This is a small text-based rpg that is far from complete and riddled with bugs.  
I built this to practice object-oriented programming with Python, and once the backend is complete have intention to add a front end map
that the player can explore visually, with portrait-style graphics for the various characters and special invents/quests.

Currently only utilizes Python
